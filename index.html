				<h2>If I had a single flower for every time I think about you, I could walk forever in my garden.</h2>

				<h2>I can stay to recall, only then has disconsolate</h2>
				<p>I love and am used to keeping a distance with those changed things.only in this way can i know what will not be abandoned by time. forexample, when you love someone, changes are all around. then i stepbackward and watching it silently, then i see the true feelings.</p>

				<h2>Love isn’t complicated, people are.</h2>

				<h2>Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.</h2>
				<p>However the world fails you, never forget your mercy and kindness that lies within.</p>
